# Dual-Band-WiFi-Network-Analyzer-
With the popularization and development of wireless networks, more and more equipment terminals communicate by accessing wireless Wifi hotspots, causing the network environment to become more complex and changeable. This product analyzes the method of optimizing the network by checking the network connection in real time, and then solves the network problem.


This product is a WiFi network analysis device that collects peripheral WiFi signals for big data analysis. It can help you identify Wi-Fi problems and find the best channel or location for your router/access point by converting your PC/laptop, tablet or mobile device into a wireless network analyzer.
How to use network analyzer

Module introduction:

1. Function main interface

Open the network analyzer APP, enter the main interface of the function (Figure 1);

If the user does not turn on WiFi, the APP will pop up a dialog box prompting the user: Turn on WIFI authorization (Figure 2)

Click each function menu on the main interface to enter the relevant columns to view network information and historical/offline records.
